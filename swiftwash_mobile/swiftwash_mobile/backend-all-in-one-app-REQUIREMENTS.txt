can u create a  new file - detailed instrcutions for 1st, testing teh main user app for maps and addresses saving and is properly saved

and also create another file with detailed instructions for referal offers that are there in the home screen, like by adding a referal for new users, as in a system where a referal code is generated by an already existing user, and the user that was refered can access the app. once redeemed, the user and the referred user both gets 50% off both premium and swift premium when we do roll out the subscription 

 i want another file which has a detailed order id generation based on the geocode or like whatever google maps service can be utilised for a detailed order id generation based on state, city, direction (8 directions eg. N, S, SE etc.) and pincode as well as the type of order for eg. irn or IRN for iron and wsh for wash and SFT or sft whichever is suitable for backend and code, also add urg (or all caps) for upcoming urgent orders as well as a std(extension along with the order type for student plan we are planning to roll out later on) & a rfr for referred 50% discount one , like idk how to achieve this but like using firebase only and if the app and backend app should have access to the order id

after that also add a spec sheet/doc help & support using maybe vertex ai api or gemini for google cloud api (both of which are enabled in the two apis i provided), and also a talk to human option in the help and support screen (is this number correct (fetched) prompt - if not - tell us ur number pop up) which requests a ring (default call ring with an alert modal/pop up prompt with phone number of said customer) in the admin app and if even that isnt responded just give the number of all the admin from the admin collection 


and then a doc that has a very detailed backend all in one app, but when we start developing this, we will start from very basic, and only one thing should be there, only user list and nothing else, it shouldnt even be interactable, we will then work on what happens when u tap on an user, and then addresses screen and then all the address field with maps embed on top, and then a maps screen to navigate, we will work on it one by one, one step at a time cuz when i tried making it earlier, it had become a mess and wasnt even able to properly work, maps wasnt working properly at all so we will imlement places api, and then routes, and then routes optimiztion api, one step-one reponse/ai prompt at a time or like mutiple prompts for one single smallest feature-this is very important  - 

and a final doc when the complete app dev - both admin operation app and and main user app is complete architetcure and also i want the order id generation be made paralley so that it is refected in the both apps and backend and firebase, so it doesnt use any sorta fall back, i tried doing this but it would always use fallback id - so also mention in the spec sheet that this is to come up with a viable solution and all the docs should have this mentioned, like each and every one, this is very important
